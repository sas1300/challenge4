## Challenge 4:  *Coding Quiz Challenge* ##

## What ##
* In the Coding Quiz Challenge we were give the task of creating a multiple choice, timed quiz that would cover a variety of JavaScript concepts. This project was to include the following:
    * A start button
    * A timer
    * Questions and a selection of answers
    * A means of keeping score based on time
    * A way to end the game
    * A way to track high scores

## Why ##
* This quiz is a good way for us to practice our knowledge of JavaScript concepts in a fun way as well as developing our practical skills by creating the quiz.

## How ##
* This challenge required the use of the following:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript

## Successes and Challenges ##
 During this project I found it very difficult to recall all of the information we have learned and apply it to creating a functioning quiz.  Due to that, I found it difficult to complete all of the steps required to duplicate the mock-up.
 I did have success in creating a basic HTML layout and was able to generate the questions in sequential order and present the choices of answers.
